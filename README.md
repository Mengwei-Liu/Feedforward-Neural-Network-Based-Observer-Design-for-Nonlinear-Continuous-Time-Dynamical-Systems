Feedforward Neural Network-Based Observer Design for Nonlinear Continuous-Time Dynamical Systems
Observer design for continuous-time dynamical systems typically relies on structural transformations and observability conditions that enable the reconstruction of unmeasured states from partial measurements. Classical approaches such as high-gain observers, KKL observers, and Kalman-like schemes often require explicit knowledge of system dynamics and strict regularity assumptions. In this work, we develop a feedforward neural network-based observer framework that follows the general design outline of classical observer design theory. Two representative systems, Duffing oscillator and a cooperative DC microgrid system, are used to generate sampled state-output data for training the neural network in PyTorch. The learned model is embedded into the observer to estimate the true system states. The effectiveness of the proposed observer is validated by comparing its estimated states with the true system trajectories.
